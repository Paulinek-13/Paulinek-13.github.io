Unzip it to a directory where you store programs files (or anywhere you want). Copy the Tim's destination directory (the one you chose) and add it as a new system environment variable, so that you will be able to use the tool from any directory on your computer. However, it is recommended to create one folder for all of your sites. </p></section><section> <h1>Running Tim</h1> <section> <h1>By double-click</h1> <p> You have to be in a directory where you have (or want to have) your site folder. After launching the app, Tim asks for a name of the task and for a site name. If you want to execute an app-task - just type <kbd>enter</kbd> on site name. </p> </section> <section> <h1>Via command line</h1> <p> In this case you can be in any directory on your computer as long as the path of <var>tim.exe</var> is set as system environment variable. Execute <var>tim</var> or <var>./tim</var> to make things easier, or use this structure to speed up: <var>tim [site_name] [task_name]</var> or <var>./tim [site_name] [task_name]</var>. If you want to execute an app-task - omit <var>[site_name]</var>. </p> </section></section><section> <h1>Tim's tasks</h1> <p> There are two types of tasks: app-tasks and site-tasks. As the names suggest, app-task does not require site name, while site-task changes site folder. </p> <section> <h1>App-tasks</h1> <ul> <li> <var>help</var> - prints helpful information about the app. </li> <li> <var>v</var> - prints the current version of Tim. </li> <li> <var>todo</var> - prints a 'todo' list with what changes expect in the future releases. </li> </ul> </section> <section> <h1>Site-tasks</h1> <ul> <li> <var>new</var> - creates a new site folder named with given site name in the current directory and copies an example site to it. </li> <li> <var>build</var> - copies everything from <var>_feed</var> to final site folder and then generates complete HTML pages. </li> <li> <var>clean</var> - deletes final site folder. </li> <li> <var>info</var> - prints some information about the site: number of folders, number of HTML files, number of other files, keys with values from <var>_data.txt</var> and keys with values from <var>_config.txt</var>. </li> <li> <var>delete</var> - deletes the whole site (folder). </li> <li> <var>pack</var> - reduces sizes of files in final site folder by putting everything in one line and allowing only one space in a row (if you need more space characters use special HTML code). </li> </ul> </section></section><section> <h1>Site folder structure</h1> <p> If a site is named "Example", then its structure looks like this: </p> <ul> <li> Example <ul> <li> <var>_base.html</var> - This HTML file determines how every page on the site looks like. It is just boilerplate HTML code. However, you can put different types of variables or condition blocks. </li> <li> <var>_config.txt</var> - This is a configuration file in which you can change some aspects of how Tim works on your site. </li> <li> <var>_data.txt</var> - In this file you can store your global site variables. Always remember to put a <var>url</var> variable. </li> <li> <var>_feed</var> - In this folder you put everything you want your site to have. When it comes to HTML files, write only a page content. </li> <li> <var>Example</var> - In this folder Tim will put the final site after building. Its name is always the same as site name. </li> </ul> </li> </ul></section><section> <h1>About <var>_base.html</var></h1> <p> It is a core for every HTML page on your site (a boilerplate code). You can use variables and 'if' blocks to change page's content depending on different circumstances. Always put <var>_content</var> variable in it to include content for every single page from <var>_feed</var> folder. </p></section><section> <h1>Structure of <var>_data.txt</var> and <var>_config.txt</var></h1> <p> These files are very similar. They store keys with their values in this way: <var>[key]:[value]</var> (in a single line!). In <var>_config.txt</var> file you can change some default values for defined keys. You just change Tim's configuration. On the contrary, in <var>_data.txt</var> you add your keys and assign your values to them. They are like 'global site variables' to use in any HTML file in <var>_feed</var> folder or in <var>_base.html</var>. Do not use colon for your keys, but for their values - you can. Always set <var>url</var> variable in <var>_data.txt</var>! </p></section><section> <h1>Creating site content</h1> <p> Think about <var>_feed</var> as a folder you would normally write your site in, except for its HTML files. In this case they have two sections: the first one is data section and the second is content section. In data section you can add local variables with the same structure as in <var>_data.txt</var> file. To start next section put <var>;:</var> in one line. In content section you can use all types of Tim's variables and 'if' blocks in addition to normal HTML. </p></section><section> <h1>About final site result</h1> <p> After build task, everything will be copied to output folder (a folder with the same name as your site), but HTML files will be generated, meaning all variables are replaced with corresponding values and all 'if' blocks are took into consideration. Every page will be the same until you add <var>_content</var> variable to <var>_base.html</var>, so remember about it! </p></section><section> <h1>Variables</h1> <p> There are several types of Tim's variables, but every variable has the same structure: <var>&#126;[type][name]&#126;</var> (if you really need to write tilde character in an HTML file use special HTML code <var>&#126;</var>). </p> <section> <h1><var>_</var></h1> <p> Type for already defined data, meaning you do not have to assign any values since Tim does that (except for <var>_url</var> which has to be set in <var>_data.txt</var> and <var>_content</var> which is taken from HTML files in <var>_feed</var> folder). </p> <ul> <li> <var>&#126;_content&#126;</var> - everything from content section in a file from <var>_feed</var> folder. The most important variable. </li> <li> <var>&#126;_name&#126;</var> - a name of the site. </li> <li> <var>&#126;_url&#126;</var> - a site's base url specified in <var>_data.txt</var>. </li> <li> <var>&#126;_this_url&#126;</var> - an url of the current page. </li> <li> <var>&#126;_title&#126;</var> - a title of the page. If file is an index.html the title is the parent folder name otherwise the title is just page file name witout .html extension. </li> <li> <var>&#126;_prev_links&#126;</var> - links to all folders that are ancestors for current one. Everything is inside <var>nav</var> tag with two classes: <var>nav-links</var> and <var>prev-links</var>. Each link is an <var>a</var> tag with two classes: <var>nav-link</var> and <var>prev-link</var>. </li> <li> <var>&#126;_next_links&#126;</var> - links to all folders that are children for current one. Everything is inside <var>nav</var> tag with two classes: <var>nav-links</var> and <var>next-links</var>. Each link is an <var>a</var> tag with two classes: <var>nav-link</var> and <var>next-link</var>. </li> <li> <var>&#126;_feed_links&#126;</var> - links to all folders that are just after <var>_feed</var> folder. Everything is inside <var>nav</var> tag with two classes: <var>nav-links</var> and <var>feed-links</var>. Each link is an <var>a</var> tag with two classes: <var>nav-link</var> and <var>feed-link</var>. </li> <li> <var>&#126;_page_links&#126;</var> - links to all HTML files in the current folder. Everything is inside <var>nav</var> tag with two classes: <var>nav-links</var> and <var>page-links</var>. Each link is an <var>a</var> tag with two classes: <var>nav-link</var> and <var>page-link</var>. </li> </ul> <p> Examples: <var>&#126;_name&#126;</var>, <var>&#126;_next_links&#126;</var>, <var>&#126;_content&#126;</var>. </p> </section> <section> <h1><var>:</var></h1> <p> Type for data you defined in <var>_data.txt</var>. </p> <p> Examples: <var>&#126;:url&#126;</var>, <var>&#126;:MyVariable&#126;</var>. </p> </section> <section> <h1><var>+</var></h1> <p> Type for data you defined in current HTML file. </p> <p> Examples: <var>&#126;+date&#126;</var>, <var>&#126;+category&#126;</var>. </p> </section></section><section> <h1>Condition blocks</h1> <p> They are used to include a specific text block if a condition is met. You can use only supported conditions with this structure: <var>&#126;_if.[condition]&#126;</var> or <var>&#126;_ifnot.[condition]&#126;</var>. </p> <ul> <li> <var>page.site_index</var> - if current HTML file is/isn't site's index page. </li> </ul></section><section> <h1>Configuration keys</h1> <p> They are used to change configuration for specific site in <var>_config.txt</var> file. </p> <ul> <li> <var>to_pack</var> - says which files extensions Tim should take into consideration while 'packing' (default: <var>to_pack:.html,.css</var>). Use comma as a delimiter and start each file extension with a dot. </li> <li> <var>index_page</var> - says if Tim should write link to "index.html" during <var>&#126;_page_links&#126;</var> (default: <var>index_page:false</var>). Set to "false" to omit that link and to anything else to include the link. </li> </ul></section> </article> </main> <footer> footer </footer> <script src="https://paulinek-13.github.io/script.js"></script> </body></html>
